### Archie's Notes No. 3

Some of you have been kind enough to indicate your interest and enjoyment of the previous issues so this gives me encouragement to continue. As I have said before I do want to make the issues interactive, so do please submit any interesting information you come across. In this issue I am including an interesting article sent to me by Joyce Wallace regarding the Royal Bank of Scotland.

#### ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND

Have you ever noticed the sentry box at the North-East corner of the Headquarters of The Royal Bank of Scotland (formerly Dundas House) at 36, St Andrew Square? Now used by the Bank's Commissionaires, it was built in 1831, before the advent of "Group 4" to ensure security of the coin of the realm. This was the year prior to the Reform Act of 1832 and the bank officials were taking precautions against the" threat of outrages from the mobs".

The Bank's archivists produced a booklet some time ago entitled "The Diary of John Campbell - a Scottish Banker and the Forty Five", based on information found in the Bank's records. In this is given an account of the demands made by Bonnie Prince Charlie that the Bank provides gold coin to pay his Highland Army and of how Campbell, the Cashier (the equivalent of the present day Bank Manager) and two Directors of the Bank walked up to the Castle, where all the funds had been taken for safety during the occupation of Edinburgh, carrying a white flag and claiming to be desirous of conducting their client's banking transactions. Allowed to proceed, they later emerged under the noses of the Hanoverian garrison, bringing with them the gold guineas which they later handed over to the Prince. The Jacobite invasion of England in 1745 was financed by The Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank was never prosecuted for its treasonable activities!

#### TEASER

Last issue's Teaser was where was Edinburgh's "Albert Hall".

The answer is that it was in Shandwick Place. The plaque of Albert's head is just above a doorway a few yards west of Lizar's shop. Apparently originally built as the Albert Gallery in 1876.

The Teaser for this issue is - Where will you find inscribed stone Coats of Arms of Edinburgh and Glasgow adjacent to one another and WHY? I am certain that you have passed these inscriptions on many occasions.

The article I am including in this issue comes from a book published in 1890 from the writings of a lady called Miss Alison Hay Dunlop. The book was published by her brothers after her death as a memorial. Apparently she had a great interest in the Edinburgh of her time and wrote a series of articles recording researched history and life in the old town. I have had to condense this article but I hope that this does not retract from its interest.

#### WESTER PORTSBURGH

Portsburgh, or the burgh of The West Port, was pre-eminently the trade suburb of Old Edinburgh. The Burgh had its own Court House, Clerks, Treasurer, Jail etc. The Court House was latterly used as a "Trades Hall" and was removed in the late 1800s. Following the ill-fated Battle of Flodden in Sept.1513, a frantic effort was made, in the Spring of 1514, by all the citizens to create a new defensive wall to protect the Town from an expected invasion by the "auncient innemys". All through the winter of 1513/14 the population lived in fear, and childless mothers and bereaved widows were forbidden to weep in the streets. The English invasion did not come!

Outside the West Port, located at the lower end of the Grassmarket, and at other gates of the Flodden Wall new suburbs arose. Two of the districts were afterwards joined to become the ancient Burgh of the Barony of Portsburgh; namely Easter Portsburgh and Wester Portsburgh. Easter Portsburgh lay beyond the Potter Row (or Kirk o' Field Gate, and Wester Portsburgh outside the West Port. The two districts however did not adjoin. They were separated by the suburb of Bristo, which lay outside the Bristo Port, sometimes known as the Society or Greyfriars Port. The districts however originally formed part of the Barony of Inverleith which in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries belonged to the Touris family. The Barony covered approximately the area from Wardie Muir to the High Riggs, Drumdryan, Tollcross, Dalry and Bristo.

Outside the West Port were the buildings of the King's Stables and the Castle Barns and the Tournament ground (a natural amphitheatre) called the Barasse. Nearby, and still outside the gate, was the Pre-Reformation Chapel of the Virgin Mary of the Rock Â­the memory of which still lingers on in the name of Lady and Chapel Wynds.

In 1648 the superiority of the lands of Portsburgh was sold to the Magistrates of Edinburgh for 27,500 merks and in a Charter of 1649 Easter and Wester Portsburgh created into one whole Burgh of Barony of Portsburgh with a Baron Bailie appointed by the Council as well as two resident Bailies. The area of Wester Portsburgh was approximately west of the Vennel to Lochrin, the whole of Lauriston, High Riggs to Home Street, Leven Street to Bruntsfield Links. To the north the St.Cuthberts Minister's "Glebe", which today covers part of the Caledonian Hotel, lower Lothian Road and Castle Terrace.

The lands of Orchardfield or "Grinlay's Grun' " belonged to John Grindlay, a tanner, part of which today is Bread Street. Grindlay's name is still remembered in Grindlay Street. Main Point, at the junction of Bread Street and East Fountainbridge, was a "gusset house" in the 1870s. The Burgh had its own justice system with "Jougs" and whipping stations. There was a Burgh Jail called the "Toppal" which stood just inside the West Port entrance. The building deteriorated and larger premises were established at the corner of Lauriston. The West Port was removed in 1786.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

1\. Princes Street was first lit by gas on 10th January 1822. Electric light was first turned on in the street on 11th April 1895.

2\. In 1905 a 22hp Crossley car carrying 6 passengers was the first motor vehicle to ascend Arthur's Seat.

3 In 1853 the Queens Own Highlanders marched from the Castle to Granton to join the ship "Golden Fleece" which was to take them to Crimea. The route from the Castle was lined from start to finish by thousands of cheering citizens. It was such a magnificent farewell that people who were there remembered it for the rest of their lives.
