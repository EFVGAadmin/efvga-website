### Archie's Notes No. 22

#### JAMES CLERK MAXWELL (1831-1879)

was born at 14 India Street in 1831. He was one of the outstanding scientists of his time, a genius who had more influence on 20thc. physics than any other in his field. He paved the way for Einstein's Theory of Relativity, yet even to this day is largely unheard of by the public. He is certainly one of the cleverest men Scotland ever produced and even on the world stage he is recognised. Maxwell's scientific brilliance never achieved the recognition it deserved and, unlike many of his contemporaries, he never received any national honours. It is only lately that his achievements are becoming more recognised. Maxwell's genius lay in his development of the theory of Electro- Magnetism, the principle of which defined how every piece of equipment from Telephone through to TV and Radar operated.

Maxwell was the son of a lawyer who had his roots in Galloway. His mother had died when he was 8 years old. As a boy he went to Edinburgh Academy and, at 15, his first research paper was submitted to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He also carried out research into the behaviour of molecules and the principles of colour vision. He was at Edinburgh University at age 16 where his forensic thinking was encouraged. He later continued studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, and then took the Chair of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he married the Principal's daughter. He subsequently became Professor at King's College, London. His research here defined his brilliance and he continued his study into Electro-Magnetism and his belief that this could be developed in a laboratory, which led to the development of radio. Maxwell's genius spread also in other directions. An example of this was in managing to identify the correct structure of Saturn's Rings. His research proved correct when more than 100 years later a space probe went to the planet. Maxwell did not like London and yearned for Scotland and he retired at the age of 34 and returned to his Galloway roots. Freedom from teaching gave him the opportunity to write the book which would establish his reputation world- wide. His treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, published in 1873, sparked universal interest and was the starting point for advances developing from it. In 1871 he was lured south to become the first Professor of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, which was to become one of the world's foremost centres of scientific research. Unfortunately Maxwell was suffering from abdominal cancer and died in Cambridge in 1879 and was buried in Kirkcudbrightshire. There are few tangible memories to James Clerk Maxwell and he has never received the public or official recognition his brilliance deserved.

#### DANCING ASSEMBLIES

were part of the social scene in the 18th and 19th centuries and were controlled by a Master or Mistress of Ceremony. Mid seventeen hundreds there was the Hon. Miss Nicky Murray who organised them with a rod of iron, controlling every aspect such as timing and the choice of partner for each dancer. One of the best reports of these Assemblies was that of LORD HENRY COCKBURN (1779-1854) who was Lord of Session 1830 and obviously mixed in the best social circles. Writing around 1810 he describes St.Cecilia's Hall as the best and most beautiful concert room. There, he saw most of the literary and fashionable society showing off their curls, frills, ruffles and silver buckles and stately matrons stiffened in hoops and satins chaperoning beauties in high heeled shoes and powdered hair with lofty, artistic head dresses. Cockburn drew the parallel between the opulence of these assembles and the destitution and disease in the nearby Cowgate. Cockburn had missed the earlier days of dancing establishments in the West Bow and Assembly Close but had seen the changes made when they moved to Buccleuch Place and George St. Here he saw the last vestige of Ballroom discipline where martinet dowagers and venerable gentlemen acted as Masters and Mistresses of Ceremonies. No couple could dance unless each party was provided with a corresponding ticket detailing their precise place in each dance. For example should the ticket be marked 3.5 this meant that holder was to place himself in the 3rd dance and 5th from the top. There is no doubt that mothers would do anything possible to ensure that daughters would dance with a choice partner, making requests in advance from the Dance Director. The duties of the M.C. then became extremely difficult. Cockburn suggested, tongue and cheek, that the election of the Pope would be easier. The rigid discipline changed with the move to the New Town, although the "old guard" fought the change every inch, no doubt yearning for the elegant parties of their youth.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

MONS MEG was cast in Mons, Flanders in 1449.

In 1457 Mons Meg was presented by the Duke of Burgandy to James II as a wedding gift. The weight is 6 tons and the cost was £1036.

In 1460 it was used at the siege of Roxburgh Castle where James 11 was killed.

In 1497 Meg was also fired at Norham Castle.

In 1558 to celebrate the wedding of Mary Queen of Scots to the French Dauphin the cannon was fired and the ball travelled approximately 2 miles to land on Wardie Muir (where the Botanic Gardens are today).

In 1754, with the Disarming Act after Culloden, Mons Meg was taken to the Tower of London.

In 1829 Walter Scott was instrumental in having it returned to Edinburgh Castle.

John Knox, in exile in England, was made vicar of Berwick-Upon-Tweed and later was offered the Bishopric of Rochester which he refused.
