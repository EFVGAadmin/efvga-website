### Archie's Notes No. 5

Sitting recently in a Kwik-Fit waiting room I picked up a small publication called "The Porthole - a window on Leith" which contained a number of interesting items on the history of Leith. Reading this brought home to me the number of similar publications I have seen over the years prepared by various local history groups around the city. These groups have done a tremendous job in researching many little interesting aspects of Edinburgh's history in their own localities. They are well worth picking up so look out for them in libraries, shops, waiting rooms etc.

Talking of small interesting historical aspects of Edinburgh, I have been pleased to receive two such items from members and I am delighted to include them here.

The first of these was sent in by Bill Williamson and is an extract from a Scotsman article in June written by James Gilchrist and refers to MARLIN'S WYND: '... up into the Tron Kirk, you find yourself contemplating the cobbles of Marlin's or Merlyon's Wynd, a 16th century vennel built over during the construction of South Bridge and uncovered when the Tron floor was lifted in the 1970s'. According to Reekiean lore, Merlyon was the Frenchman who first paved the High Street. In his monumental book *The Place Names of Edinburgh*, however, the late Stuart Harris dismisses this, suggesting it more likely that the name came from one Walter Merlyon, mason and burgess of Edinburgh, members of whose family worked on the Great Hall of Holyrood House, although a grandson may indeed have been a causey-makar, a layer of streets. . .....

The second item comes from Liz Keeves via Jack Budge and answers something that I have been endeavouring to discover for some time, namely the peculiar Lion sculpture in the Canongate Churchyard. It is a CHIMERA (or CHIMAERA) pronounced *kimeera*, which my dictionary describes as a Greek Mythological fire breathing female monster with a lion's head, goat's body and a serpent's tail. It can also mean something hoped for but illusory or impossible to achieve.

However the following is the explanation:-

CHIMAERA means illusion. It represents the Greek symbol of evil. It is a triple monster- an unholy trinity, unnatural and divided against itself.

Lion = Force. Goat = Luxury. Serpent = Fraud and Falsehood.

In its clutches is an eagle, the symbol of an oppressed people - it covers its young. The boy plunges a knife and kills an illusion.

Not by night, but by the Lord, Not by evil, but by faith.

Sculptor: Josephine de Vasconcellos.

Exhibited in the Sculptor Exhibition of the 1955 Edinburgh Festival and priced 500 guineas, it weighs 4 tons and has been left on permanent loan. With difficulty the T.A. section of the Royal Engineers moved it to its present location. It was exhibited in the Royal Academy in London in the 1940s.

#### LADY STAIR

Rosalind Masson, in her book "Edinburgh", writes about Lady Stair and, if true, gives an intriguing twist to the famous story. The story of Eleanor, Lady Stair, the former Lady Primrose, is well known to us all and is referred to in Chambers â€œTraditions of Edinburgh" and also the plot of Scott's "Aunt Margaret's Mirror". The scandal of Lady Stair being seen at her window in the morning forced her into marriage with him. Masson, in her book, states however that around 1911 the wife of the Rector at St. Peter's-upon-Cornhill discovered an entry in the register showing a marriage had taken place between the widow of Primrose and Stair 6 years before the Edinburgh scandal. Why were they married by licence, far from home with concealment of titles? And why was the marriage kept secret in spite of the scandal? The reason, according to the author, was a further discovery in Register House, Edinburgh, of the profligate Primrose's will which left the care of the four children, three sons and a daughter, all under five years of age, to the guardianship of their mother - but only for as long as she remained unmarried. After that they were to be taken over by a cousin. Lord Stair died in 1747 forty years after the secret marriage. Lady Stair survived him for twelve years, living in Lady Stair's Close, with the only surviving one of her four children, the unmarried daughter, â€œMistress Primrose". What do you think?

#### MARY KING'S CLOSE

Ginny Spencer has written to me regarding a reference made in a TV programme to dying victims of the plague being bricked up in the Close. She had doubts about this (as I had) so I decided to ask Professor Michael Lynch, Head of Scottish History at the University for his view on this subject. Professor Lynch replied that there was little written reliable information on the 1645 plague but he states 'those infected with the plague were isolated in what was a virtual internment camp, situated at the Meadows, until they died. But no one was buried alive!'

Thank you Ginny for bringing this to our members' notice, it is important that we get our facts straight whenever we can!

#### TEASER

I am sure that many of you knew the answer to the last one.

The plaque to Sir Robert Philip is high on the west wall at the foot of Bank Street.

This issue's Teaser might be a little more difficult: Where is the location of the Quakers' Graveyard?

I know you have passed it at some time.
