### Archie's Notes No. 13

I was very grateful at the recent AGM when a number of members came up and expressed their appreciation for the Chat, which encourages me to continue digging up these "thumbnail' items for your interest and information.

#### TOWN CADIES

Many people have written about our famous Cadies, their name coming from the French "Cadet". Two who have contributed are J.G. Lockhart (Walter Scott's son-in-law) and Tobias Smollett. For the purposes of brevity I have summarized their remarks.

The elevation and density of Edinburgh tenement population was such that searching out a stranger, or anyone else for that matter, among hundreds of staircases, was, to say the least, a major undertaking. It therefore became necessary to have citizens who were agile enough to climb staircases and carry messages. These Cadies generally came from highlands, a few each year to be added to the Corps already in town. They had the ability to climb stairs with the agility they used when in their native mountains and they would carry out the commands of their employers with unquestioning zeal. In order to carry out this laborious profession it was necessary to make themselves familiar with every stair, every house, every family and every individual. They also had to keep up with details of every new resident. All in all, for a group who had little, if any, learning or reading and writing skills, theirs was a mammoth task. The Cadies, though shabby in appearance, rudely familiar in their address and cocky in their attitude, nevertheless, were so noted for their fidelity that there is no instance of them betraying a trust. They were also famous for executing romantic errands with absolute discretion.

Smollett, however, gives another aspect to the Edinburgh Cadies when he refers to a Dinner and Ball in Leith to which he and a few other friends were invited by the Cadies. Apparently the Corps had invited all the young noblemen and gentlemen who were at the Races to the Dinner. In a large hall, long tables were joined together and a Cadie Fraser was the toastmaster. Fraser was a veteran and known and respected by all the company. The banquet was both elegant and plentiful with the Cadies all dressed in decent apparel with clean linen. Ladies were in attendance for the Ball and were, of course, provided by the hosts! The evening ended with each Cadie standing behind one of the guests exclaiming 'Noo we're your honour's Cadies again'. I suppose that this can be regarded as an early form of corporate entertaining!

Over so many years this remarkable Corps of Cadies, individually almost anonymous, have written themselves into a special place in the fabric of Edinburgh's history, and as we know their name still lives on at golf courses to this day.

#### GREAT FIRE OF 1824

Edinburgh's Old Town was always vulnerable to fire but 1824 seemed to be a year when these were more prolific. Fires had taken place in Niddry St., North Bridge, Bank Close and Parliament Square etc. In November, however, came the greatest fire disaster to take place in Edinburgh. The fire is reputed to have started in a printer's premises on the south side of the High Street between the Tron and St.Giles, although there were other theories. Fire engines were called but in the beginning no water was available and this, associated with very high winds, meant the fire got a good hold and spread quickly. Fire engines from all over the city were brought in but their efforts were too little and too late. As would probably happen today, people of all classes flocked to the site, many trying to help. Such was the conflagration, however, that their effort was puny. Eventually they must have become a nuisance to the fire-fighters and soldiers had to be used to line the streets and keep back the crowd. In the beginning there appeared to be no one in overall charge and fire fighting plans were haphazard. Old tenements from the High Street down to the Cowgate had flames belching from the windows; sparks and embers were flying all over and starting other fires. People in the street were having their clothes catch fire. Apart from this there was a continuous terrifying roar drowning other sounds. As the fires increased and with the very strong wind, it appears it developed into what we would call a â€œFire Storm" today. Floors within buildings were collapsing, stone walls were melting into a "sort of glass", and buildings were collapsing all around. Sparks ignited the Tron spire and the Tron bell melted. Next day they thought they had the fire under some control but the next night the whole terrible scene started again. By this time firemen and helpers were completely exhausted. Mines laid by army sappers brought down some of the dangerous walls. At its peak, the fires could be seen 20 or 30 miles away. Hundreds of people, many of them very poor, were rendered homeless and troops guarded salvaged furniture on the street. There were of course some fatalities. The homeless were housed temporarily in Queensberry House. A charity fund was set up and the public sympathetically donated nearly Â£5000. The longer term effect on poorer people must have been tragic.

Some people thought that the fire was a heavenly judgment as Edinburgh's recent Music Festival was regarded as a godless act!! It may have been an act of providence that St.Giles was spared but it may also have been the wind blowing in the right direction.

#### TWELVE APOSTLES HOUSE

This house was situated in the Cowgate at the foot of Libberton's Wynd. The building was taken down in 1829 for the erection of George IV Bridge and was a good example of semi-fortified town house. A strong square tower, representing the appearance of a narrow Border Peel, contained a comparatively well-lit staircase which had a stout oak door beautifully panelled. In the uppermost story of the west wing was a double dormer window, surrounded by a pediment on which were carved the heads of the Twelve Apostles. On the top was a figure supposed to have been a representation of the Saviour but at the time of demolition the upper part of the body had been broken off. Tradition has ascribed the east wing of this ancient building the name of "The French Ambassador's Chapel". On the first floor above the street there was a room with two attractive windows and legend has it that Mary, Queen of Scots, used it.

#### DR. ALEXANDER WOOD (LANG SANDY,1725-1807)

Lang Sandy was a leading figure in the medical scene in Edinburgjh. He is one of those Edinburgh characters who percolate down from the town's historical mist. A well kent and well-loved figure in the town, he seems to have been respected by all. He did much to improve the health and sanitary conditions prevailing at that time. But as so many of those old Edinburgh figures were, he was a little eccentric. A man of tall and striking features, he was usually seen on his rounds with a tame raven and followed by a pet sheep. He is also reputed to have been the first person seen in Edinburgh with an umbrella. He was of a convivial nature and helped to found some of the town's medical social societies. Professor Andrew Duncan wrote of him as follows:-

_Here lies Sandy Wood, a good honest fellow,very wise when sober, but wiser when mellow.At sensible nonsense no man excelledwith wit and good humour dull care be repelled.Shed no tears my good friends, wear no garments of sable.Sandy Wood is not dead but laid under the table_
