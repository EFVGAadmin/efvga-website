### Archie's Notes No. 19

#### SIR JOHN HEPBURN and the ROYAL SCOTS

In 1633, Sir John Hepburn raised a regiment to fight for Louis XIII of France, known as the Regiment d'Hebron. It was said to be some 800 strong and became one of the finest military units on the continent. Hepburn was made a Marshal of France but died at the moment of his triumph at the Battle of Severne. Apparently Cardinal Richelieu expressed his sorrow at his death. The regiment continued in France until Charles II recalled it to Britain as The Royal Scots (1st Regiment of Foot).

#### THE SCOTS GUARDS

The Scots Guards' first military action after their formation was at Rullion Green on the Pentlands. They fought under Sir Tam Dalyell against the Covenanters in November 1666.

#### JAMES VI an AUTHOR

James VI, sometimes called the "wisest fool in Christendom", was also a best-selling author and the driving force behind the version of the Bible which bears his name. In 1604 he wrote a work which has a resonance today, his "Counterblast to Tobacco". It was a serious attempt by James to curb a social habit he saw as a pernicious vice. Comparing smoking to excess drinking, he referred to its medical and anti-social consequences, a custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs. His views lost some of their strength however by his own fondness for drink and had, apparently, little effect being regarded as a joke. In the present climate of medical opinion, his views seem remarkably modern!

#### TEASER

The answer to the Teaser in issue 18 is that the Protestants supported by donations from Edinburgh churches were in Lithuania.

The Teaser this time is "What were Wellington's Ears"?

#### DID YOU KNOW?

1\. The message displayed on the Floral Clock to mark the end of WW2 was "Our Finest Hour'.

2\. In 1701, a ban was put on cockfighting in Edinburgh streets because crowds brought traffic to a standstill.

3\. The first Professor of Midwifery and Obstetrics in Europe was appointed in Edinburgh in 1726.

4\. The Scots American War Memorial or "The Call", in Princes Street Gardens was placed there in 1927 as a memorial to Scots Americans who died in WW1. The statue was proposed by Prof. R Tait MacKenzie of Pennsylvania University and was cast in the Roman Bronze Works in Brooklyn. The model for the memorial was said to be Granville Carel one of MacKenzie's students. If you look at the statue closely you will see there is a slight variation in the soldier's stockings.

#### KIRKBRAE HOUSE AT EAST END OF DEAN BRIDGE

In preparing this item, I am grateful to Joyce Wallace for pointing me in the right direction and also to the late Basil Skinner for research he carried out on the subject, both for his book and his writings for The Old Edinburgh Club in the early 1980s.

Before the bridge there was a house, before the house there was a deep ravine to the Water of Leith. The builder of the house is not known but it was probably built around 1680/90. The turnpike road to the north went down Bell's Brae and there was a Toll-house at what is now the junction of Lynedoch Place and Bell's Brae.

The House has had a number of owners and uses over the centuries. In the 18thC it was and inn and talked of as "Baxter's House of Call" suggesting that it was a pub used by the baxters (bakers). It was also well situated as a rest stop for coaches heading for Queensferry and the north. Bell's Brae remained the main road north until the first Belford Bridge was built further upriver in the 1780s which created an easier and more level crossing for the horses. The Dean Bridge was constructed between 1829 and 1832. The House has, of course, been altered over the years and has been used for various purposes apart from an inn. It is a residential property today as it has been for various times over the years. Also an office for Croall's Car Hirers, an antique shop and a confectioner.

Its longest single use however was as the headquarters for a horse cabbie business operated by a kenspeckle character called James Stewart or "Cabbie Stewart" as he was known, who took the house over in the 1860s and continued to run his cabbie business until he died in 1917 at the age of 87. He was a pillar of the Free Church and worshipped at St.George's Church in Shandwick Place and when he died in 1917 a great gathering of cabmen gathered at the Church. His method of publicity for his business at the time was by sitting outside the house with a tile hat and Inverness Cape. Tradition has it that he married his first wife just after she had benefited from a significant legacy from her former employer but by 1891 he was a widower. His business was prospering and he became one of the largest cabbies in the town while also operating horse drawn coaches to and from Queensferry. Stewart built a reputation for quality and maintenance, both for horses and equipment. He had built a hay barn, coach house and stables at the foot of the hill and also operated a smithy. Around 1890 he planned a big extension to his house and employed an architect for the purpose. The new extension would extend down the hill -Â 6 floors until it reached a rock seating for the foundation. In effect it became a tower-house, with one or two rooms on each floor, originally with friezes bearing biblical quotations and a fine wooden staircase. Some years ago the late Bill McKelvie told me that there was a small minstrel gallery in the tower but I am not able to confirm the authenticity of this. Diversion took place over the years and gradually the business part separated from the residential. If you look at the house on the bridge today you will still see under the doorstep the name James Stewart. There are also a number of Latin inscriptions on the stonework as well as a decorated panel with the inscribed Baxter's Arms and the words "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" Gen 3, Verse 19 and the date 1619. This plaque was probably placed here at the time of the extensions and taken from one of the old baxters' buildings in the village. Some people may still remember that during the last war a pill-box was located just outside the house to guard the bridge. If you are walking across the bridge one day, do pay attention to the house and its inscriptions and think of its history and its part in the folklore of Edinburgh.
