### Archie's Notes No. 2

I hope that you found something interesting or amusing in the first issue.

Like many other Guides I have a great interest in books giving the history of Old Edinburgh and have collected quite a number. Reading over these old books will always result in the discovery of some little known gem of Edinburgh history of which you have not previously been aware. It, of course emphasises the point, you are always learning something new about Edinburgh. It is an ongoing study!

I have taken the following information from a book produced in 1929 which I found interesting. The information, summarised here for you, was written by the then Depute Town Clerk. If you are already aware of it please forgive me but I am sure that it will be new to many members.

#### THE 4th (OR LOST) TOLBOOTH.

The first Tolbooth or "Pretorium" stood for an unknown period up to 1385 at the South East corner of St.Giles on the ground now occupied by the Thistle Chapel. It appears likely that an English invasion of the year destroyed the building as no reference is made to it afterwards.

Everyone is aware of the Old Tolbooth which stood at the North West corner of St.Giles and of which, of course, you can see the brass stud outline on the cobbles today. The site was gifted to the town in 1386 by a Charter of King Robert II known as the "Bellhouse Charter". The bell was no doubt used for various purposes such as calling meetings of the Council and fixing hours for buying and selling. The building served a number of purposes and was the meeting place not only of the Town Council but also of Councils and Parliaments. It was the centre of public and official life down to the Reformation in the 1560s. Afterwards it became a prison and it is from this last degenerative phase it chiefly derives its fame. It was eventually demolished in 1817. The foundation stone of the new Calton Jail was laid in 1815. At the time of the Reformation the Old Tolbooth was in great need of repair. In fact it was in such poor condition that the Lords of Session feared for their safety and were threatening to move to St.Andrews. The magistrates authorised the building of a New Tolbooth at the South West corner of St.Giles at a cost of £4012 Scots.

Until the new building was completed accommodation was provided in St.Giles. Partition walls were put up and the space divided into upper and lower rooms. The west portion of the nave became known as the Tolbooth and the Church which subsequently met there was known as the Tolbooth Church.

According to the writer, it is apparently difficult to find details of this 4th and New Tolbooth but it appears to have been a plain and unpretentious building, 3 storeys high, having "laigh and high counsell houses". It served from 1564 to 1811 and was then demolished. It is strange that a building which served the Town for nearly 250 years has passed into almost total obscurity. For your information I have copied a little diagram below giving the location.

In the last issue I indicated that I hoped members would contribute items of unusual historical interest or any information of any kind which would increase our knowledge of Old Edinburgh. In addition comments or ideas will always be most welcome. I was therefore extremely pleased to receive the undernoted article from Ginny Spencer which I am sure will be an interesting supplement to your knowledge.

#### THE SANCTUARY LINE - ABBEY STRAND.

From the time of the founding of the Abbey of Holyroodhouse in 1128, sanctuary for crimes of all types was given until the Reformation in 1560 after which it was given for the crime of being a debtor only. The Church offered sanctuary by appointing "maisters of girth" to hold what amounted to preliminary trials before handing anyone over to the state. At the Reformation the bounds were extended and no longer ran from the Girth Cross, but from the strand or little burn (now culverted) and marked today with the three brass letters "S". In 1880 imprisonment for debt was, in most cases, abolished. The Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act of 1913 practically ended the need for it. The right of sanctuary, however, has never been repealed.

The sanctuary seekers known as "Abbey Lairds'" were safe from arrest within the confines of the Sanctuary which included several taverns and extended over what is now Holyrood Park. They could venture outwith the boundaries for 24 hours from midnight Saturday until midnight Sunday. This was particularly appreciated by the Ministers who could return to their churches for the day! The buildings on the north side of Abbey Strand are the 16th c Abbey Sanctuary buildings which once formed part of a residence for aristocratic debtors. The Comte d 'Artois (brother of the deposed Louis XVIII and later Charles X) was an Abbey Laird from 1796-9, and as Charles X from 1830-32. Thomas de Quincey was also there on a number of occasions in 1835.

Some interesting dates:

- 1128 Holyrood was prescribed as the greatest sanctuary.
- 1383 canons were forbidden by Parliament to protect murderers.
- 1469 law against protection of murderers renewed.
- 1560 the Reformation swept away all right of ecclesiastical sanctuary.
- 1880 the Bailie of Holyrood's Court Book records the last entry.

The present Baron Bailie now superintends the 30 High Constables of Holyrood who form a guard of honour there on ceremonial occasions. Bi-annually, in June, they also walk the 4-5 mile boundary of the Sanctuary of Holyrood.

#### TEASER

Last issue's Teaser was Where is the inscribed stone "Hae God Hae A'"?

It is on the old St.Cuthbert's Co-op HQ in Fountainbridge. There are others such as "Co-operation seeks to promote the welfare of all", and "He that would reap must sow".

The Teaser this time is where was Edinburgh's "Albert Hall"?

I know that you have passed it and walked under the plaque!

#### DID YOU KNOW?

1 The last Sedan Chair for hire in Edinburgh stood at the corner of Great King St. and Dundas St. until the 1870s.

2 In the late 1800s there was a fortnightly horse sale at Croall's, Castle Terrace. The premises were called the "Royal Horse Bazaar".

3 The Burgh Court held in the City Chambers ceased to function in May 1930. Lord Provost Whitson presided and a number of magistrates and councillors were present. Two minor cases of traffic contravention were on the roll, the offenders being dismissed with an admonition. The Court had been in existence since the 15thC.
