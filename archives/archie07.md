### Archie's Notes No. 7

The history of Edinburgh has always appeared to me as a gigantic jigsaw with the larger pieces being the great historic events and the innumerable smaller pieces completing the picture. It is some of those smaller, less well- known, pieces which we try to highlight in this publication. One of such items I picked up from papers I had received from Bill McKelvie some years ago.

These papers specifically related to GREYFRIARS CHURCH and Churchyard and concerned a speech given at the rededication service of the Church on 7th January, 1934. The rededication followed a partial restoration of the Church. Lord Sands gave a résumé of the history mentioning that it was first opened for public worship on Christmas Day, 1620. In the century it was opened there had been three main historical events. Two of the events of which we are all aware were the 1638 signing of the Covenant and in 1679 the confining of the 1200 prisoners in the Churchyard. The third event was unknown to me, and I think may also be new to many members.

_"A die was cast when the Covenant was signed but another die was cast within the walls which profoundly influenced the course of British history. Cromwell was dead. All was confusion in England. There was a military dictatorship without a dictator. General Monk summoned his officers stationed in different parts of Scotland to Edinburgh. His meeting took place in Greyfriars Church. Monk declared himself opposed to the military dominance of England and invited officers to join him in an endeavour to make the military power subservient to the civil. All within the church agreed to join the attempt and as soon as troops were collected the historic march on London began"_

Also among the Greyfriars' papers is a detail of the Kirkyard written by George Hay, in 1959, in which he indicates that the long narrow south burial yard, erroneously termed the "Covenanters' Prison", was not enclosed and added to the Kirkyard until 1703, 24 years later than the date of the Prison. It was in the now built -up area south of the upper yard that the unfortunate prisoners were confined in 1679.

#### ROYAL INFIRMARY

While preparing some slides for a talk and in particular, one of the old Royal Infirmary in Infirmary Street, I picked up, with the aid of a magnifying glass, partial sight of two plaques. While not able to read the complete inscription it was obvious that the wording was the same as the two plaques above the present main front entrance to the "Royal" at Lauriston, viz. "I was a stranger and you took me in" and "I was sick and you visited me". I do not believe the plaques at Lauriston are the originals but the wording is the same.

In addition there is the statue of George II which was brought from the Infirmary Street hospital. This of course answers last edition's TEASER regarding the location of the statue.

With the history of the plaques and statue I wonder if anyone in our Lothian Health Board Trust has given any thought to relocating these historic items to the new Hospital at Little France or will they just vanish from sight as so many other relics have done?

Where are "Granny's Green Steps"? You will have to be up to date with this one!

#### THE HOLYROOD OR DUNKELD LECTERN

You will recall in issue No. 6, I made reference to the Lectern and its present location. Information from various sources came to me regarding the Lectern, not least from the Rev.Charles Robertson in his talk to us at Canongate Kirk. I am most grateful for their help.

In November, 1984, a group calling themselves Siol Nan Gaidheal (Seat of the Gael), broke into St.Alban's Church and removed the Lectern. Subsequently much discussion took place between many parties, including representatives of the Scottish and English Churches, but still the Lectern was not returned. Intermittent discussions continued into the 1990s. The demands of those who had the Lectern were that it should not leave Scotland and no action should be taken to prosecute those responsible. St.Alban's Church authorities were unable to meet these conditions but undertook to support the return of Lectern to Scotland if it was first returned to them as they still claimed ownership. In an endeavour to solve the problem, St Margaret's Church, Barnhill, Dundee, which had a Victorian replica of the Lectern, agreed to donate it to St.Stephen's, in the hope that the real one would come forward. On 7th May, 1995, this replica was handed over by the Church of Scotland. Nothing was heard from those responsible for removing the Lectern!

The Scottish Parliamentary elections seem to have been the catalyst for movement and on Friday, 30th April, 1999, the Lectern was delivered anonymously to the Netherbow Arts Centre. The Lectern has been placed in the custodian-ship of the National Museum of Scotland, apparently until the whole question of its ownership and eventual resting place can be established.

#### ALL HALLOWS FAIR IN THE GRASSMARKET

Mrs. Stewart Smith in her book "Historic Stones and Stories of Bygone Edinburgh" gives a wonderful description of this Fair held annually on the eve of All Saints. The chapter is too long to relate in full here but I hope that I can give you some flavour of her enthusiasm for this real auld Scottish festival. To start she quotes part of a poem.

_Amang auld Reekie's merry ploys,There's never been seen sic' daffin',Sic' heezin, hamely, hearty joys,Sic' lots of lightsome laughin',Wives wi' their men, weans wi' their toys,A'loupin', rompin', quaffin',While sneakin', squeakin', souls rejoice,Right busy giffin', gaffin'._

Shows were erected all round the Grassmarket, brilliant with colour and blazing with torches. Men bawling incessantly and deafening drums forever beating while Harlequin and Columbine were tripping lightly on fantastic toes and the Fairy Prince was discovering Sleeping Beauty. As evening advanced, the crowds gathered from every close and the noise and din increased.

Gingerbread stalls were one of the chief attractions, particularly for the young, being produced in all sorts of animal shapes, the stall-holder occasionally throwing a few into the crowd to encourage business. Toys galore and boys galore with trumpets, rattles, whistles and drums. Anything and everything that could make a sound! Fortune Tellers, Punch and Judy, the Dwarf, the Giant and the Bearded Lady, the Waxworks. Barrows selling mouth-watering candy, apples and roasted nuts. In addition a special event for the young lads and lassies to dance or meet up in some quiet corner. Or according to superstition in those days, a lassie may pare an apple without breaking the peel, then throw the paring over her left shoulder and whatever form the paring took was said to foretell the first letter of the future lover's Christian name!

All making a night to remember for the young and old of bygone Edinburgh and another chapter in the history of the Grassmarket.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

Captain John Slezer, one of the most famous Edinburgh topographical artists, was forced to take refuge from his creditors in Holyrood Sanctuary for the last few years of his life. His great work Theatrum Scotiae was issued first in 1693.
