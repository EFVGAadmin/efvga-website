### Archie's Notes No. 11

With the Chairman's kind permission I am continuing the "Chat" but have, of course, changed the name. Not inspirational, but it was the best I could come up with. If, however you have any other bright ideas please let me know! I was delighted after the AGM that so many members came up to me and said how much they appreciated the "Chat" and hoped it would continue.

#### TEASER

In the last issue, this referred to the original planned location of the Ross Fountain. The architect of the Caledonian Hotel, John Dick Peddie, planned to have a grand entrance forecourt in which he would place the controversial fountain which had been a focal point at the Paris Exhibition in 1867 and which had been purchased, as a well-meaning gesture, by Daniel Ross, Gunsmith. Apparently he purchased the fountain in the interest of art but its semi-naked female figures upset Victorian Edinburgh and was damned as "grossly indecent and a disgrace to the City". The Town rejected the site and every other site suggested, but eventually, with the help of Peddie, the Council agreed to set it in its present site but sensitively screened by trees.

The Teaser this time is: Where and what was Paul's Wark?

#### PALACE AND ORATORY OF MARY OF GUISE

The Palace was on the site of today's Assembly Hall at the foot of Castlehill and was built after the Hertford invasion of 1544 when Mary, Queen of Scots, was an infant. Holyrood was no longer safe, so the Queen Mother decided to have a new Palace and showed some judgement and taste in her choice of site. Safety was improved by being under the protection of the Castle guns and also away from street 'tulzies' and up a close with fitted gates. Other evidence of wise foresight was the provision on the site of an old draw well with an inexhaustible supply of clean, fresh water. Apart from the practical considerations, the site had great views, particularly to the north.

The internal decoration of the Palace and Chapel were said to be the finest of any old Edinburgh house. In two of the Oratory rooms prior to 1820, there were two carved oak mantelpieces, the four pilasters of which were carved with the figures of the four Evangelists. The oak for the beams was not local, but brought (probably) from the Baltic. The roof beam in the Chapel was ornamented on three sides with conventional designs in gold and colours. Especially noteworthy was a series of trusses with long finials of pomegranate and grape leaves. The carvings were of the highest quality, characteristic of old Scottish carvings prior to the Reformation. It has been suggested that the quality was similar to that of the Stirling Heads.

A gallery on the first floor passed over the Close from Palace to Chapel. In there was a fireplace decorated in Gothic architecture with a niche, probably used to display alter plate. Niches were a feature, there being seven in all but only one had a drain hole. This was a distinctive mark of a piscina of the Roman Catholic Church. The Palace had panelled walls, arched roofs, ornamentation and heraldic ceiling paintings. Also built in in was a secret chamber, entered by a moving panel and exiting on to a secret turnpike. All remaining undiscovered for generations? The furnishings of the Palace and Oratory would be in keeping with such an elaborately built and royal residence. This was a royal lady who had been in the highest echelons of French society and quality would be evident.

In the Inventories of Mary, Queen of Scots, published by the Bannatyne Club, Mary's mother possessed 12 sets of tapestries, one of these containing "the historic judgement of Salaman, the deid bairn and the twa wifiesâ€ , the tapestry being made of "worsett, mixed with reid' gold", and 5 palls of cloth and Turkey carpets. Mary, Queen of Scots, had 36 of these carpets. After the Queen's death in 1560, the building, for 250 years, passed down through a succession of wealthy tenants and was finally divided into small houses, deteriorating over the years. The building was taken down in 1845 for the erection of the Church of Scotland's Assembly Halls.

#### THE CUNZIE HOUSE

This was the Royal Mint. It had various locations in the Old Town and dates are confusing. Holyrood and the Castle were two sites but around 1550 the building stood on the west side of Candlemaker Row where it joined the Grassmarket and fronted Cowgatehead. It had a timber- arched porch with outside stairs and ancient balustrades, wooden eaves with crow-stepped gables. Money was coined in Scotland from the time of Alexander I until the Union of 1707. In 1574, in a specially erected and semi-fortified building in South Gray's Close, Regent Morton finally established the Scottish Mint with the inscribed legend 'Be merciful to me O God 1574". Here the Mint remained until 1707 when all the Scottish coin dies were destroyed. The range of coins produced were called lyons, unicorns, angel pieces, bonnet pieces, nobles, nonsunts, ryders, ryals, merks, half merks, crown groats, groats of flower-de-luce, pennies, placks, bodIes and bawbees. The Mint was destroyed in 1877.

#### MERCAT CROSS

When the original Cross was taken down, the sculptured medallions were removed and built into a tower named Ross's Folly erected in the grounds of St.Bernard's, Stockbridge. Walter Ross had bargained with the Town Magistrates for some stones but was not getting an answer so one morning without permission he carted 4 of them away. Argument ensued but the stones were never returned. According to his dying instructions, the Folly became its owner's grave. The next owner of St.Bernard's was Sir Henry Raeburn and when he died in 1824, the tower was taken down for feuing purposes and the medallions were given to Sir Walter Scott. The 4 heavy stone carvings were loaded by masons into carts, to be taken to Abbotsford, by the carter, Tom Purdie. Apparently Walter Scott thought it a great joke that Purdie, to protect the stones on their long and bumpy journey, filled the carts with manure, which he thought was the safest and most ideal form of packing. There was of course plenty of water in the Tweed to wash them on arrival. The medallions are still built into the walls at Abbotsford.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

In the late 1700s new industries were being developed and one of these was Coach Building. In 1783, an Edinburgh Coach Builder sold 1000 crane-necked carriages to Paris. Many were also exported from Leith to St. Petersburg and the Baltic area. Lord Provost Creech claimed that "Coaches and chaises were constructed as elegantly in Edinburgh as anywhere in Europe, and, it may be added, stronger and cheaper".

In 1783 nearly the most common profession in town was the "Haberdasher", which category included mercer, milliner, linen draper, hatter, hosier, and glover. Perfumers also had beautiful shops in the main streets and some were said to use bear fat for greasing ladies' and gentlemen's hair!!!
