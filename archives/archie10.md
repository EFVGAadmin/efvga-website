### Archie's Notes No. 10

#### THE STORYTELLING CENTRE

The following is taken from the Autumn edition of "Blethers", the magazine of the Scottish Story Telling Centre, Netherbow, and I am grateful to Donald Smith, the Director, for his permission to give this extract.

For the next two years the Centre will be based in the Moubray House shop while the work on the development of the Centre is completed.

Moubray House, like the John Knox House, is a great survivor from Edinburgh's medieval Old Town. George Jameson, Scotland's first great portrait painter, lived there and Daniel Defoe also lodqed in the house when spying for England during the union negotiations in 1706-1707.

The new Centre will have every modern facility, including an activities centre, for families and schools and an enlarged 100 seat theatre. There is planned a striking new Netherbow Bell Tower which will be created on the line of the 1471 King's Wall between John Knox House and the existing Netherbow Centre. The Tower will be a contemporary feature, designed by Malcolm Fraser, architect, and not a historical pastiche but it will house the surviving features of the old Netherbow Port.

The Port Bell is the official City Bell and was cast in Middleburg, Holland. The Latin inscription on it reads "To God be the Glory. Michael Burgerhuis of Middleburg made me at the request of the senate and people of Edinburgh in 1621 and I was hung on the topmost tower. Wha Daur Meddle Wi Me?

An ancient plaque was put in the Port as a demonstration of Edinburgh's gratitude and loyalty for the escape of James and Anne from Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot. The Bell will be hung at the top of the Tower and will ring over Edinburgh using its own distinctive voice. On it will be the sculptured plaque dated 1606 which bears the crown and initials of James VI and Queen Anne of Denmark as well as James's personal motto "Beati Pacifici" below the words 'God Save the King'.

#### TEASER

The Teaser in the last edition referred to the location of Hatton House today.

The answer, as I am sure many of you are aware, is Queensberry House.

The Teaser this time is: Where was the Ross Fountain, now in Princes Street Gardens, originally planned to be sited?

GRANNY'S GREEN STEPS

In a previous edition I mentioned the building of these steps between the Grassmarket and Johnston Terrace. You may have subsequently read in the newspapers that there was some problem in the building of these steps. In fact the original flight of steps was completely torn up. Recently a new and wider set of steps has been built and lamps are being fitted alongside but at the time of writing they are not yet open to the public. A very costly exercise! Who paid?

#### MUSICAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH

The history of this Society is fairly well documented and anyone really interested in more detail than I can give here can easily follow this up. I thought, however, that the following summary might be of interest.

The Society was first instituted in 1728. Before that time some gentlemen performers formed a weekly club, meeting in the Cross Keys Tavern. Following the success of this group a membership of 70 (later rising to 300) set up the Society for the purpose of holding weekly concerts. Meetings were held in St.Mary's Chapel and then a Concert Hall was built in Blackfriars in 1762. The building, designed by Robert Mylne, was based on the Opera Theatre at Parma. The design is in the form of an amphitheatre holding around 500 and excellently adapted for music. The expense of building was defrayed by a voluntary subscription among members.

There were a number of foreign singers and musicians employed by the Society and weekly concerts were held. An annual grand concert was held in honour of St. Cecilia, the patroness of music, and these could include Handel's oratorios. There were also concerts performed, completely by gentlemen members. The music performed at concerts was a mixture of what was called at that time, modern and ancient classical style and these could be intermingled with Scottish songs.The Society lasted for well over 50 years and established a reputation throughout the whole country for elegant and sophisticated entertainment.

#### CALEDONIAN HOTEL

You may have read that the "Caley" (now the Caledonian Hilton) has just reached its 100th birthday after taking four years to build: The original name was however "Princes Street Station Hotel" with the telegraphic address "Luxury, Edinburgh". At the time of opening, the Wright Brothers were making their first short flight, Henry Ford was establishing his small motor company, Cinderella was showing at the Theatre Royal, Cook's Siberian Circus was in the Waverley Market and the popular song of the day was "Sweet Adeline". The Permian sandstone facade was quarried in Dumfriesshire and brought to the adjoining station by train. The building, with its red colour, added flamboyance to the greyer buildings around and with the fresh stonework was a great attraction.

The Caledonian Railway Company was formed in 1845 planning to open up a railway line between Carlisle and Glasgow with a spur from Carstairs to Edinburgh, this all, of course, to link up with routes to London. The site for the original terminus was opposite today's Usher Hall and was to be named Lothian Road Station, with the hotel adjoining. The Railway Company, however, ran into financial difficulties but they were determined to go ahead and commissioned the talented architect, John Dick Peddie, to design both station and hotel. The building of the hotel was deferred and only the station was built in 1848. The hotel was opened in 1903 a short distance down Lothian Road from where it was originally planned. Many of the great stars of stage and screen have stayed there over the years, but I wonder if the management really did enjoy Roy Rogers, the cowboy, riding his horse Trigger up and down the stairs of the hotel.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

In 1530 there were 288 female brewsters in Edinburgh. In 1660 Edinburgh Magistrates were ordered by the Privy Council to erect a stone pillar near the Mercat Cross where bankrupts were to be placed wearing the traditional yellow bunnet and suffer public humiliation.
