### Archie's Notes No. 14

#### GAS

In edition No 3, I made reference to the fact that Gas Light was first introduced to Princes Street in 1822 but Gas light made its first appearance in Edinburgh in 1816 in two shop windows on the South Bridge. The owners of the shops clubbed together in making a small manufacturing unit in a cellar behind their premises. It was not until 1818 however that the Coal Gas Works was set up at the North Back of the Canongate. Finding it a prosperous concern, an Oil Gas works was established in Leith in 1821. Sir Walter Scott was Chairman of the Managing Committee.

#### ROBERT GOURLAY'S HOUSE

On the site of Melboume Place stood Old Bank Close. Here, on the ruins of the town house and Chapel which belonged to the Abbots of Cambuskenneth and utilizing the carved stones of the same building, Robert Gourlay built his house, one of the most massive in the Old Town. It was said that many of the stones of the previous ecclesiastical building had catholic carvings on them but when they were re-used these were turned inwards and the stones re-dressed for the new building.

Gourlay is a bit of an enigmatic figure. Ostensibly he was a Messenger-at-Arms with connections to the Palace at Holyroodhouse and with a salary of Â£40 per year plus perks! Not a pauper but on the face of it not one of the richest men in town. Robert Gourlay however appears to be a man of some mystery. His position in a relatively humble office contrasts with his connections in a more distinguished circle. In later years, although he had the favour of his patron James VI, he was wealthy enough to build his grand mansion in 1569 when James was just 3 years old. There appears to be a suggestion that his wealth was as a result of bold mercantile speculation, possibly using "insider" information to profit in his transactions. In 1574 Gourlay, an elder of the kirk of Edinburgh, was "ordained to make his public repentance in the kirk for the sin of transporting wheat out of the country during a dearth". Gourlay had purchased his wheat-selling monopoly from Regent Morton and tried to assist him without success. He definitely had contact in the right places but did not seem to be approved by his neighbours. He desired to live apart and was involved in a right-of-way case.

Gourlay's house had a substantial flight of stairs leading from the same point to different parts of the mansion. On the demolition of the house in 1834, a secret chamber was discovered between the ceiling of the first storey and the floor of the second. Gourlay appears to have put his house in the service of the Government, no doubt for "a consideration" and, during his lifetime, it had been a "holding house" for state prisoners of gentle birth. There was a turret in the house containing a curious spiral stair which led to a room which was used as a temporary prison with a small closet adjoining for the "lockman". Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange and Regent Morton are reputed to have been confined here. This private house, in a self-contained close, could have been a useful place for all types of clandestine meetings or as a stopover for the influential. Sir William Drury, Commander of the Castle in 1573, was lodged in the house.

Eventually Gourlay's grandson David retired to Prestonpans and sold the house to Sir Thos. Hope of Craighall. Another of its famed tenants was Sir George Lockhart of Carnwarth, Lord President of the Council, who was assassinated by Chiesly of Dalry.

#### TEASER

The last Teaser was "Who was Jedidiah Cleishbotham"? This was a nom-de plume used by WaIter Scott to hide his identity as a writer.

The Teaser this time is ''Where will you find St Ninian, St Kentigern (or Mungo), St Magnus and St Columba as well as Christ speaking to St Andrew"?

#### GEORGE DRUMMOND

Born Blairgowrie 1687 Died 1766 (buried in Canongate Kirkyard).

Employed at 18 as Secretary to Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, one of the commissioners preparing for the Union with England. He later was employed by Customs and Excise and by 1715 was a Commissioner of Customs. Drummond was one of a new breed of executives who did not come from the aristocratic, merchant or craftsmen classes. As a young man he had committed himself to the Crown and the Union and he never changed. In 1717 he became City Treasurer and in 1725 he was elected Lord Provost, to the displeasure of the town's Jacobites. In his first period of office he supported the establishment of the Medical College and the Royal Bank. In 1727 he resigned from the Council to concentrate his efforts on the setting up of the Royal Infirmary. He also served on the Board for the Encouragement of the Fisheries, Arts and Manufacturers of Scotland. Some years later Drummond went into a period of financial and mental depression and apparently drank heavily. He was also in a state of religious fervour. He had been widowed for the second time with a brood of children. Apparently he was in difficulty with his peers at that time which put him under more pressure. Drummond gave evidence at the Porteous Trial. With all his personal problems he was still working on city projects of which the Infirmary was uppermost. Back in the Council again he was Lord Provost in the "small crisis" of 1745. About ten years later he married a wealthy lady which turned his fortunes around and he bought a property in Broughton known later as Drummond Lodge and now commemorated in Drummond Place. Drummond was Lord Provost for the sixth and last time in 1762.

#### PAPAL NUNCIO.

In 1430 James I received the Papal Nuncio, Archbishop of Siena, who had been sent by the Council of Ba'le. He was still here when James was murdered at Perth and also attended the execution of the Earl of Atholl for his part in the murder. The Papal Nuncio was Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini. Piccolomini was born at Pienza in 1405 and was raised to the Papal Throne as Pius II in 1458. For many years prior he had been Archbishop of Siena and later his nephew, who became Pius III, built a Library to house his collection of books. The Library was adorned with frescoes by Pinturicchio depicting the life of Pius II. One of the frescoes depicts Aeneas Sylvius being received by James I of Scotland and Edinburgh Castle and shipping in the Firth of Forth (according to Pinturicchio) appear in the background. Pius II died in 1464. I can confirm the fresco exists because recently Archie Fleming and I and our wives visited Siena and in the Duomo saw the Library with the wall fresco and the depiction of Edinburgh, the Castle and the Firth of Forth and its shipping. Pinturicchio had of course never seen a Scottish Castle so he drew what he knew, a castle in the Italian design, but otherwise it is as Piccolomini described the scene to him even down to the rain sweeping over! So if you are ever in Siena in Tuscany, go to the Duomo Library and see the wall fresco with colours as fresh as the day they were painted and pick up on this connection between Italy and Scotland. The Earl of Atholl was executed, somewhat gruesomely, by means of a red-hot diadem being placed on his head, the operation of which carried on for 3 days!

#### AN ANONYMOUS POEM (from late 1800s)

_St.Margaret what a sight is here,Long miles of masonry appear,Scott's Gothic pinnacles ariseAnd Melville's statue greets the skies,And sculptured front and Grecian pileThe pleased, yet puzzled, eye beguileFrom you far landscapes where the seaSmiles on in softest witcheryTill riant all, the hills of FifeFill in the charms of country life_

#### DID YOU KNOW?

Some time ago I picked up a little book, printed in 1945, which gave a lot of interesting facts on Edinburgh. Some of these facts I will reveal here and in future editions and I hope that you will find them illuminating !!

1\. Who put the "Murray' into Murrayfield ?

Early in the 18thC, Archibald Murray of Cringletie (on the Eddleston Water) acquired the lands of Nisbet of Dean and renamed them Murrayfield

2\. Rudyard Kipling's "Gunga Din" first appeared in the Edinburgh periodical, the Scots Observer, edited by W.E.Henley, 7th June, 1890.
