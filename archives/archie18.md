### Archie's Notes No. 18

Joyce Wallace has kindly pointed out the mistake in Chat 17 regarding the clock which was originally on the Netherbow Port. It is now located on the Dean Gallery and not, as I said, the Gallery of Modern Art. I am also grateful to Joyce for submitting the following articles which I am sure you will find of interest.

#### LAWNMARKET

Have you ever wondered why the Lawnmarket extends as far east as St. Giles Street? The answer is given by the late Stuart Harris in his magnum opus "The Place Names of Edinburgh" published in 1996. In the Town Council Minutes of 1526, markets are appointed for both "burgh" and "land" but by 1656 it appears that there was a separate "land" market on three days a week and by 1690 the name had become attached to the upper part of the High Street, between the Tolbooth (the vicinity of St.Giles Street entry) and the Bowheid. So it had originally been part of the High Street and, once established, was called the Launmarket, the "d" of land (or laund) not being pronounced. It was reserved for vendors who came in from outside the burgh and who therefore had to pay taxes on their sales.

#### MARLIN'S (MERLYON'S) WYND

The entry under Merlyon's or Marlin's Wynd also shatters some long held beliefs. Walter Merlyon was a mason and burgess in Edinburgh who witnessed a charter in 1490 but is referred to in a protocol of 1530 as "the late Walter Merlyon". He was from a family of masons, possibly originating in Fife. The story related in William Maitland's History of Edinburgh 1753, that Walter Merlyon, a Frenchman, was hired in 1532 to pave the High Street for the first time is palpably untrue, not only because Merlyon was not French, was not a causeymakar and was dead before 1532, but because the contract for the paving work detailed in the Town Council Minutes for 1532 was not with Merlyon but with two Frenchmen named Mayser and Foliot, causeymakars. While the claim that it was for the first paving of the High Street, rather than repair or extension of causey work, is in contempt of the fact that the cleansing contracts of 1505 and 1509 referred to 40 roods (ten Scots acres), an area which must have included all the streets of the burgh. Indeed considering that the technique of causeywork had been introduced from France to Scotland before 1400, it would be astonishing if Edinburgh had not made use of it before the 16thC.

#### TEASER

Last issues Teaser related to Register House. The original building was regarded as a government building and the alcoves were originally placed as sentry boxes.

The Teaser this time is:- In 1720 a subscription list and collections were established by the Presbytery of Edinburgh to assist suffering Protestants in a foreign country. The amount raised was some Â£821. What was the country?

#### GEORGE HERIOT'S SCHOOLS

It may be that, like me, you have been confused by the number of George Heriot Schools which have been quoted. To clarify I have made some investigation. I found an Edinburgh and Counties Directory of 1868-69 which was helpful but I am sure was not the complete picture. The information I have obtained is as follows :-

CHARTERS GEORGE HERIOT'S SCHOOL

_For the maintenance reliefe, bringing uppe and education of poor boyes, freemasons' sons of the town of Edinburgh. Number of pupils 180, none are admitted under, nor above 10 years of age, they leave when 14 years. The Governors are desirous that every boye admitted should be able to read the Bible and indicate that the suitable elementary education implied by this standard will hereafter be held an important feature in their consideration for every application. Governors, Lord Provost, Magistrates, Ministers and Town Council._

GEORGE HERIOT'S FOUNDATION SCHOOLS

The children of burgesses and freemen who are unable to provide for their support; and 3rd. the children of poor citizens and inhabitants of Edinburgh living within the parliamentary bounds of the city.

The Foundation schools listed are as follows:-

1\. Heriot Bridge, Grassmarket 2. Cowgate Port

3\. High School Yards 4. Old Assembly Close

5 Borthwick's Close 6 Brown Square

7 Rose Street 8. Broughton Street

The following were Infant Schools

9\. High School Yards 10 Old Assembly Close

11\. Rose Street 12 Broughton Street

13\. Victoria Street

I am sure this is not the complete list but if you have any further information please let me know.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

1\. Kenneth Graham, the author of "Wind in the Willows", was born at 32 South Castle Street. This man who wrote what always seems to me the most English of stories was a Scot. Educated here, he moved to England to join the Bank of England and eventually became Secretary of the Bank. He spent most of his life in the south, had poor health and retired early. He wrote a number of stories but his greatest, in 1908, became a world classic.

2\. Peter Mark Roget (1779-1869) was born in London. His father, a Swiss, died when he was very young. A bright student, he came to Edinburgh University to study and graduated in 1798. His famous Roget's Thesaurus first appeared in 1862 and is still being printed.

3\. 14 bombing raids took place on Edinburgh in WW2. There were 17 deaths as a result.

4\. It is estimated that something like 20% of the population of Edinburgh died as a result of the plague.

5\. In WW1 the old Waverley Market was used to produce tank parts.
