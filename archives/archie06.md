#### HERTFORD'S INVASION 1544.

In April 1544 Henry VIII ordered Lord Hertford to invade Scotland "putting man, woman and child to fire and sword where any resistance shall be made against you". He chose a new method of invasion. Embarking his troops at Shields he landed near Leith which he occupied. Regent Arran declined battle, withdrew his troops to Linlithgow and left Edinburgh to its fate. The Lord Provost came out to meet him but when he heard of the demands - unconditional surrender and the delivery of the Queen's person (then a baby) - he refused and gave orders for the defence of the town. The citizens mustered under the Blue Blanket but were no match for Hertford's artillery. The Netherbow Port was blown open, the English troops poured through the town slaughtering citizens and setting fire to houses. The Castle, however, was a different proposition, returning fire so effectively that the English troops ran, suffering quite severe losses. Before Hertford left he had sacked and burnt Edinburgh, wrecked the Abbey Church and gutted the Palace. Only the Castle stood impregnable.

In the loot carried off by Hertford's officers, Sir Richard Lee secured two notable objects. One of them was the "fair font of solid brass" which Abbot Bellenden had presented to the Church at Holyrood the previous century. Lee's home was near St.Albans and he gave the font to the local minister where the reformed clergy had it engraved with a Latin inscription which translates as follows:-

_When Leith, a not inconsiderable town of the Scots, and Edinburgh, their principal city, had been destroyed by fire, RICHARD LEE, knight, rescued me from the flames and brought me to the English. In return for this good deed, I, being hitherto used to wash none but the children of kings, have now yielded my services even to the meanest of the English. Such was the will of the victorious Lee. In the year of our Lord 1544._

For a hundred years the font remained the chief ornament of the St.Albans minster but in the civil wars it was taken and melted down. Lee's other prize is still reputed to remain in St.Stephen's Church at St.Albans. It is an eagle lectern of brass inscribed with the legend:

GEORGIUS + CREICHTON + EPISCOPUS +

DUNKELDENSES

George Creichton was Abbot of Holyrood till he became Bishop of Dunkeld in 1522 so this may have been his parting gift to the Abbey. His coat of arms appears on the lectern. It narrowly escaped the same fate as the font but clergy prudently buried it where a sexton, digging a grave, discovered it in 1750.

Has anyone been in this church in St.Albans and seen if the lectern is still there today?

#### TEASER

The Quakers' Graveyard is on the right through the arch of the University property in the Pleasance. It is just a grassed area today but there are some gravestones round the wall.

This issue's Teaser is:- Where will you find the only statue in Edinburgh of George II (1727-1760)?

#### THE LAST "RIDING OF PARLIAMENT"

The last 'Riding of Parliament' took place in 1707 when the procession came from Holyrood. Commissioners from each Burgh, each attended by a lackey, the Commissioners for Shires with two, the Barons, Viscounts and Earls each with a gentleman to carry his train and three lackeys behind. Then came the heralds, resplendent in their tabards, in front of the "Honours of Scotland," the crown, the sword and the sceptre, each in the hands of its hereditary bearer. Next came the Lord High Commissioner, the Duke of Queensberry, followed by a train of pages and footmen. Behind him rode the Dukes with gentlemen trainÂ­bearers and eight lackeys apiece, while the Marquises (six lackeys for them) came next. The Duke of Argyll, Red John of Battles, brought up the rear with a squadron of Horse Guards. All this magnificence was the prelude to the bribery and double-dealing which Fletcher of Saltoun denounced with such eloquence. The depth of this dealing was not meant for the public eye but the sums involved were discovered and published a few years later. Queensberry received £12,325, the Duke of Montrose was willing to accept £200, and Lord Banff the cheapest of the recipients received £11 12s.

#### TRAPRAIN LAW

This information was taken from the information boards placed by Historic Scotland at the foot of the Law.

The commanding position of Traprain Law made it a very attractive location for the prehistoric communities who wanted to demonstrate their control over the area. By around 1500BC the local Bronze Age population were using the hill for burials. Finds of axes, moulds for casting bronze and other items show occupation of the site during the Late Bronze Age. It is not clear however whether the hilltop was continuously settled at this time.

The Votadeni The main archaeological features that can be seen are the ramparts of the Iron Age hillfort. These would once have enclosed a settlement of many timber buildings. The hillfort may date back to the Late Bronze Age and was certainly occupied for several hundred years. The ramparts were replaced and rebuilt on numerous occasions. During the Iron Age the hillfort on the Law lay at the heart of a thriving farming landscape. The surrounding arable fields are rich in buried remains of farms and forts of the period.

By the later centuries BC the hillfort was probably the capital of the Votadeni tribe. These people occupied much of south east Scotland and appear to have been allies of the invading Romans during the latter part of the 1st C AD. It is possible that the Votadeni used the alliance to protect the successful economy of the area and help ward of aggressive neighbours. The fort remained the capital of the Votadeni long after the departure of the Romans until at least the 5thC AD. The successors of the Votadenian Chiefs eventually lost power to the incoming Angles around the 7thC AD.

Excavations during the early 20thC provide a picture of human activity on the Law and numerous finds were made. The most notable was a hoard of Roman silver dating from the 5thC AD. The objects found include bowls, spoons, flagons, dishes and plates, all cut up and flattened as if for melting. They had been deliberately buried. It is not clear how the Votadeni obtained this material or what it was used for. It may have been a diplomatic gift, the result of trading contacts, or even loot from raids into Roman territory.

Traprain Law has also a place in folklore and legend. According to one legend a king called "Loth" who is said to have given his name to the Lothians had his HQ at Traprain. On hearing that his daughter, Thenaw, had disgraced him by falling in love with a shepherd, Loth ordered her to be thrown to her death from the summit. Thenaw, however, survived the fall and was taken across the Forth in a small boat to Culross where she was rescued by shepherds. Here she gave birth to a son whom she called Kentigern. He was renamed Mungo by monks who brought him up and went on to become St.Mungo, patron saint of Glasgow. Thenaw was also canonised and is now known as St. Enoch.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

a. Racing at Musselburgh has gone on for many years but the other great racing events were the steeplechases held at Oatridge about 15 miles west of the city. Around 9.00 on the morning of the races there was a constant stream of horse drawn vehicles heading west some racing each other.

b. Even in the old days there were 'Stop the War' demonstrations. In 1900 during the Boer War these were held in Queen Street Hall and Waverley Market with large numbers attending. Fights took place and police were required to restore order.
