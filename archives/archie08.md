### Archie's Notes No. 8

I must start by apologising for two errors in the previous edition. The statue in front of the Infirmary is George II not George III and Elizabeth Williams has kindly drawn my attention to the Gaelic translation of the name of the group which removed the Lectern from St.Alban's Church. This should read read â€œSeed of the Gaelâ€

#### ALLAN RAMSAY (1686-1758)

Wigmaker, Poet, Bookseller, Librarian, Theatre Entrepreneur. A name and facts of which we are all well aware. In reading something about him recently, however, I realised that there was a great deal more to this man so I set about doing a little research which I thought might be of interest you. I do not pretend it is definitive but the information puts a little more flesh on the bones of Mr.Ramsay, at least for me.

Ramsay was born in Leadhills and came to Edinburgh in 1701 to be an apprentice wigmaker. In 1707 he became a member of The Incorporation of Wigmakers. He set himself up in business in the Grassmarket and plied his trade there until 1711 when he removed to establish himself in the High Street or in his own phrase 'on Edinburgh's Street - the sun-side'. He called his shop the Sign of the Mercury and it stood almost opposite Niddry Street.

Edinburgh at the time was in a depressed state with the loss of Parliament to London and much of its glory had been lost. Ramsay was affected by the prevailing gloom and set his thoughts down in some pieces of minor poetry. The making of wigs however was fairly profitable, as nearly everyone wore them. In his leisure time he began to write verse in the Scots vernacular style and in this respect he was involved in its revival and was the forerunner of Fergusson and Burns.

Though not a native, Ramsay lived the greater part of his life in the city and was identified with life there in the first half of the 18th C. He touched life at many points for he was intensely human - good-natured and jovial, if a somewhat vain man who revelled in the full blooded life of the town. He wrote Scots verse but where money-making was concerned he was practical and level-headed. It appears that, after discussion with some colleagues, he decided to give up the wigmaking business and concentrate on bookselling. This was a good move and very quickly became very profitable and in addition complemented nicely his literary ambition.

From his shop he gradually began to increase his poetic output and eventually was issuing his poems weekly on single sheets, hawked around the streets by vendors at a penny a time. In 1721 he published his first volume of poetry which was greatly acclaimed and said to earn him 400 guineas. A few years later he published his 'Tea Table Miscellany' which included songs such as 'Lochaber No More' and 'The Lass O' Patie's Mill'. His most famous pastoral poem, 'The Gentle Shepherd', was published in 1725. Such was his status and popularity now, that he decided to move his premises to the Luckenbooths. In 1728 he wrote a second edition of his poems and having decided to quit while he was ahead he made his departure from the literary scene with a book of fables.

Ramsay's one failure was the theatre which he opened in Carrubber's Close. After only six months it was closed in 1737 by an Act of Parliament which had been passed proscribing all stage play performances outside London. His only recourse was to law but he only received the puzzling verdict that 'though he had been damaged he had not been injured'. Ramsay was a member of the Easy Club which had strong Jacobite connections but it appears that he kept his head down during the 1715 and 1745 rebellions.

In 1740 he built himself the famous Goose-Pie House to spend the twilight of his years, which he did in some comfort. He was grief-stricken when his wife died in 1743 and Ramsay himself died on 7th January 1758 and is buried in Greyfriars Churchyard.

#### George IV's Visit 1822

(a) In 1822 George IV's toast at the Holyrood Banquet was â€œThe Chiefs and Clans of Scotland and Prosperity to the Land of Cakesâ€

(b) The Duke of Buccleuch refurbished Dalkeith Palace for the King's stay, including a new driveway and a ceremonial gate. He also arranged for oil lamps to be erected every 40 yards along the road from Edinburgh to Dalkeith. A bonfire using 150 loads of coal was lit on a hill above Dalkeith.

(c) An enterprising merchant inserted a mahogany log into the landing stage at Leith where the king's foot would first step with a view to converting it into souvenir snuff boxes later!

#### FREEMAN OF EDINBURGH or the BURGESS TICKET

The history of bestowing the freedom of the City goes back into history. Apparently it is not known when the custom started and the Record Roll is not complete. In the early days the aspect of freedom was different from today. A freeman was one who, in return for the right to work and for the protection from the unfree, assumed certain duties. These included payment of taxes, a share in guarding the town and a share in government. As Edinburgh grew in wealth and importance such admissions were regarded as an honour. The records show the Council's policy to those in power and the scope widened until the Roll contained names whose service was not only to the City but to the Nation and the World.

The earliest Known freeman is Sir Edward Boncle, Provost of Trinity Church in 1459. The first woman honoured is Baroness Burdett-Coutts in 1874. The next lady does not appear on the Roll until Flora Stevenson in 1905. Over the two hundred years the great and the good from this country and all over the world have been honoured. Some notable names are Sir Walter Scott 1813, Charles Dickens 1841, David Livingstone 1857, Ulysses S Grant 1877, Winston Churchill I942, General Montgomery 1946.
