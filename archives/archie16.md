### Archie's Notes No. 16

#### JOHN HOME - Author of "Douglas - A Tragedy"

Home was an Edinburgh Presbyterian minister of good character but had a secret ambition to write although the Church at that time was totally opposed to public performances. He wrote "Douglas" but it was when he decided to have it performed in public that the storm broke. Ministers and Elders were aghast and visited him, pleading for him to stop this heresy. The pleading then turned to threats but Home was adamant that the play would go on. He felt that, as a minister of the Church, his play of morality, virtue and reverence for an overriding power, was an ideal way to portray his religion to the people.

In 1757 his play was performed in Playhouse Close. It was a "smash hit" and ordinary folk went wild about it. The ministers were furious and not being able to stop. Home they turned on the actors. They threatened public disgrace, banishment and anything else they could think of but the actors turned out to be just as stubborn as Home. Home was expelled from the Ministry and a campaign of personal vilification against him and his colleagues thundered from the pulpits of Edinburgh. The beleaguered dramatist did have one friend however, the Earl of Bute, who was a fan of "Douglas". The Earl persuaded his friend the Prince of Wales to extend his protection to him, settle a pension on him and find a government position in the south where he lived safely in happy and comfortable exile. He wrote several other dramatic pieces, none of which is remembered. The amusing part of this however is that, by all accounts, the play was pretty awful and certainly did not justify the famous cry from the audience â€œWhaur's yer Wullie Shakespeare noo. Home did however throw a large brick into the stagnant pool of Scottish drama and while it went down without trace, it did leave a tiny ripple!

#### THE HOLYROOD OR DUNKELD LECTERN

You may recall that, in CHAT No 7, I wrote about the disappearance and appearance of the above Lectern and I thought you might be interested in a paper cutting I received from a friend regarding the latest position. The cutting is taken from a St.Albans newspaper dated December 2005. It is reported that a Church of England Court, known as consistory court, had decided that the Lectern could be loaned to the National Museum of Scotland for a period of three years. As mentioned previously, a Dundee Church gave a replica of the Lectern to the St.Albans Church for their permanent use. I hope that before long we shall be able to see the original Lectern in our Museum.

#### TEASER

The question was: Where is the Waterloo Well? The Old Waterloo Well is located on the east side of the Pleasance, near the Hermits and Termits House.

These following words were used by General Montgomery as part of his "D Day" address.

He either fears his fate too much,Or his deserts are small,That dares not to put it to the touch,To gain or lose it all.

A Scot, who was not treated well by Edinburgh, wrote the words. Who was he?

#### PARLIAMENT STAIRS

Parliament Stairs, also called the "Back Stairs" or the "Meal Market Stairs" had their steep descent from Parliament Close to the Cowgate. The Churchyard of St Giles, later Parliament Close, extended down the steep slope to the Cowgate, the lower part of which was called the Lower Kirkyard or Kirkheugh.

On the Kirkheugh, near the site of Parliament Stairs, once stood the Church of the Holy Rude, in which Walter Chapman endowed an altar in 1528. Walter Chapman along with Andrew Myllar, were first to introduce printing into Scotland in 1507 under the sympathetic patronage and the occasional assistance of James IV. On the west side of Parliament Close, prior to the Reformation, stood the houses of the Provost and resident clergy of St Giles. These houses subsequently became the manses of Protestant town ministers. In 1632, on the site of these buildings, was built Parliament Hall which was used for the meeting of the Scottish Parliament until the Union in 1707. The stairs were removed in the changes that followed on from the Great Fire of 1824.

#### ASSEMBLY ROOMS IN THE WEST BOW

At the first angle of the Bow down from the Lawnmarket and on the west side of the street stood the first Assembly Rooms. The building was high and picturesque and the last within the King's Wall. It is thought that the original building was erected by Peter Somerville, an Edinburgh Bailie. His initials and the arms of the Somerville family, with the date 1602 and the motto "In Domino Confido", were inscribed above the door. In the building, at the second level, was a large dancing room with a small room adjoining which was used by the musicians as a retiring room, apparently proverbially "drouthie".

In the early 1800s the premises were occupied by a Mrs Frier, a dealer in wool (Galashiels Grey, a durable wool cloth which was one of the main manufactures of that town) and Scottish blankets. The innovation of dancing was not regarded favourably in the beginning and on one occasion the Rooms were assaulted and doors burnt. The Dancing Assemblies, unlike today, were not the most joyful of occasions. Ladies and Gentlemen occupied separate parts of the Room. Minuets and Country Dances were danced without talking and under the watchful and eagle eye of the Lady Director but no doubt the genders would find a way of passing messages, either by word or written! The scene outside would be exciting with gilded, velvet lined, sedan chairs arriving and leaving with liveried bearers waiting to take the ladies home at an early hour. The lady's partner often acted as an escort by walking alongside the sedan chair. About 1720 the dancing was transferred to Old Assembly Close.

#### PAPAL NUNCIO

In Chat No.14, I made reference to the visit of Archbishop Aeneas Sylvius Piccolimini to Scotland in the 1430s. Recently, reading Maxwell's "Edinburgh", I found reference to this visit which is described as a secret mission to King James I. In his writings, Aeneas makes conflicting statements as to the object of his visit. Firstly he describes it as an endeavour to effect reconciliation between the king and a certain bishop; in the other he says he was instructed to urge the king to make war on England. Maxwell does not reveal his thoughts on the reason and we shall never know for sure but the latter would seem to me to be more credible. In his travels in Scotland, Sylvius apparently wrote that he saw "the poor almost naked, begging at the church doors, depart with joy in their faces on receiving stones as alms". He said that "the stone, whether by reason of sulphurous or some fatty matter, is burned instead of wood of which the country is destitute". Coal, of course had been worked in Scotland since at least the 1290s.

#### DID YOU KNOW?

1\. The Edinburgh Zoological Garden in Broughton Park was Scotland's first zoo and existed from 1840 to 1859 and was very popular with the citizens. The Zoo at Corstorphine opened in 1913.

2\. In 1610, "Anderson's Leith Stage" trundled from the Tron Kirk to the Shore at Leith in an hour and a half, by all accounts a very uncomfortable journey. Sedan Chairs appeared in the City in 1687.

3\. In 1911, William Hugh Ewen made the first flight over the Forth in a Duperdussin monoplane from the Marine Gardens in Portobello.

4\. Dean Village was originally known as the Water of Leith Village, the largest of the Edinburgh Milling settlements. The original Dean Village was sited approximately where Belgrave Mews is today.
