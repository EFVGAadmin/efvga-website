### Archie's Notes No. 4

I was delighted that members attending the AGM gave their support for the continuance of this publication.

#### TEASER

Last issue's teaser was: Where can you find the arms of the Cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow adjacent to one another?

They are on the building at the west end of the Grassmarket between the West Port and King's Stables Road. The building was the office of the long defunct Edinburgh and Glasgow Bank.

The Teaser for this issue is: Where in the old town will you find a plaque commemorating Sir Robert Philip, a pioneer in the fight against tuberculosis?

The site is reputed to have been the first T.B. clinic in the world. There is also a plaque to him on his former house in Charlotte Square.

#### WHITEFOORD (OR WHITEFORD) HOUSE

This article is drawn from the writings of a Mrs J. Stewart Smith who published her own book "Historic Stones and Stories of Bygone Edinburgh" in 1924. Mrs Stewart Smith not only did a tremendous amount of research but also had a talent to sketch old buildings, most of which are now gone. Most of her drawings are dated around 1860. As always with old books we are not able to guarantee the quality of research but I do believe she was extremely thorough. I hope you will find this summarized article interesting.

_The present house is erected on the site of one of a much earlier date having been the town house of the Earls of Seton in the time of Mary, Queen of Scots. It was deemed worthy enough to become the residence of Lord Darnley on his first visit to Edinburgh in February 1565, prior to his marriage to Mary. It was apparently sometimes called "Seytoun's Palace"._

_Above the large entrance gate there was an archway with a projecting shield of arms supported by two stone foxes. The inner court was decorated with large stone vases planted with various types of trees. The walls were 5 storeys high with heavy architraves over which were armorial and religious devices. Such was the mansion until the attainder of George, 5th Earl of Winton. After the battle of Prestonpans in 1715 the house was shut up and fell into a state of ruin. In 1744 the Earl died in exile in Rome and the property passed into the hands of the town._

_The gardens and grounds were then conveyed to Ebenezer McCulloch, one of the managers of the British Linen Company. The company had been incorporated in 1740 and the property appears to have become a location for its business. Shortly after, it passed into the hands of Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, the first Deputy Governor of the British Linen Company. Andrew Fletcher was raised to the bench as Lord Milton and lived at Milton House (now the site of Milton House School in the Canongate). The British Linen Co. became the British Linen Bank. Lord Milton died in 1763 and part of the grounds of Seton House was sold to John Grant, a Baron of Exchequer. The British Linen Bank moved to Tweeddale House. "My Lord Seytoun's Lodging" was levelled to the ground in 1766._

_A new house was built and called "Whitefoord House" from the name of its occupier Sir James Whitefoord of Ballochmyle, a patron of Burns. Whitefoord died in 1803 apparently having lost money in the failure of a bank in which he was involved. At the time the house was apparently still a lordly mansion with a handsome portico and a quaint torch extinguisher, said to have been the last one left in the old town. The house which Chambers called "the old villa at the Abbeyhill" came into the possession of Sir William McLeod Bannatyne, a Lord of Session who died there in 1833._

_Following this the house remained empty and deteriorated. Eventually the house was let to the Marr Typefounding Co. by the owners, the Sinclair family. Unfortunately some of the heavy machinery was put on the top floor and fell through to the rooms beneath. The house was again shut up. Some of the outhouses were eventually utilised by the Rev.A.Laurie of Old St.Paul's, in connection with the Boy's Brigade and the Episcopal Church Mission. The premises were refurbished to provide a gymnasium, drill hall, dispensary and meeting rooms. The gymnasium was opened on Christmas Day 1903. Six years later, in 1909, the property was acquired as a home for veteran ex soldiers and sailors, to replace the soldiers' shelter in the Vennel where there had been 60 to 70 inmates crowded together. The house was stretched by acquiring the adjoining Callander House (built for Sir John Callander of Craigforth) and connecting the two buildings._

#### DID YOU KNOW?

In the 1870s the Minister of St. George's West was Dr.Whyte. Such was his preaching reputation that each week hundreds of people queued, waiting to get into the church for his service. Policemen were required to control the crowd and ensure that members got in first.

Alex A. Ritchie, a Canongate boy wrote "The Wells o' Wearie". He died in 1850, aged 34.

The hymn "The Happy Land" was written by Andrew Young, headmaster at Niddry St. School and later English master at Madras College, St. Andrews. He died in 1889 and is buried in Rosebank Cemetery.

The foundation stone of the Royal High School was laid at Baxter's Knowe on the Calton Hill in July1825. The school was formally opened on 23 June 1829. A procession left the old school at High School Yards, preceded by the band of the 12th.Lancers and upwards of 700 boys, each class in the charge of a master. The Lord Provost and Magistrates and a large number of noblemen were also present. It is said that some 400 gentlemen dined in the Waterloo Hotel that evening. The rector was Dr.Schmitz who had also given tuition to Edward, Prince of Wales, at Holyrood Palace. Walter Scott and many other celebrities were educated at the school, including three Lord Chancellors -Â Wedderburn, Erskine, and Brougham.
